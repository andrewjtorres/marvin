## Setup

Dependencies in this package are maintained by [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/).

### Installing Poetry

Install poetry using the default python interpreter.

```shell
curl --location --show-error --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```

If you are not using the default python interpreter the above step won't work
as it assumes you want to use the interpreter named `python`. Instead, you can
install using the version of pip that is coupled with your alternate
interpreter.

In many cases, we want to install `poetry` to be used with `python3`.

```shell
pip3 install poetry
```

### Installing dependencies

```shell
poetry install
```
